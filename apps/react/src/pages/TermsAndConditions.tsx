				<P>
					We haven't reviewed, and can't review, all of the content (like text,
					photos, and other materials) posted to or made available through our
					Services by users or anyone else (“Content”) or on websites that link
					to, or are linked from, our Services. We're not responsible for any
					use or effects of Content or third-party websites. So, for example:
				</P>

				<ul>
					<li>
						We don't have any control over third-party websites, like source
						recipe websites
					</li>
					<li>
						A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply
						that we endorse any third-party website.
					</li>
					<li>
						We don't endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate,
						useful, or not harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or
						objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical
						mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy,
						publicity rights, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary
						rights of third parties.
					</li>
					<li>
						You're fully responsible for the Content available in your grocery
						list or recipes, and any harm resulting form that Content. It's your
						responsibility to ensure any Content abides by applicable laws and
						the Agreement
					</li>
					<li>
						We aren't responsible for any harm resulting from anyone's access,
						use, purchase, or downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting
						from third-party websites. You're responsible for taking the
						necessary precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems
						from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive
						content.
					</li>
					<li>

						seller's sole responsibility, so you must look solely to the seller
						for any damages that result from your purchase or use of Content.
					</li>
					<li>
						We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability
						for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes
						between you and the provider of any Content.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<H2>Fees, Payment, and Renewal</H2>

				<P>
					<strong>Fees for Paid Services</strong> Some of our Services are
					offered for a fee, like synchronization between devices, and
					collaborative lists. This section applies to any purchases of Paid
					Services.
				</P>
				<P>
					By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees, in the
					form of recurring fees (subscriptions). Your subscription begins on
					your purchase date, and we'll bill or charge you in the
					automatically-renewing monthly interval (or other interval specified
					by us) until you cancel your subscription. You can cancel your
					subscription at any time by visiting your account settings.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless
					explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable
					federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales,
					value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or
					charges (“Taxes”). You're responsible for paying all applicable Taxes
					relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your
					purchases. If we're obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees
					you've paid or will pay, you're responsible for those Taxes, and we
					may collect payment from you.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>Payment</strong> You must provide accurate and up-to-date
					payment information. By providing your payment information, you
					authorize us to store it until you request deletion. If your payment
					fails, we suspect fraud, or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for
					or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit
					card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid
					Services), we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid
					Services without notice to you. You authorize us to charge any updated
					payment information provided by your bank or payment service provider
					(e.g., new expiration date) or other payment methods provided if we
					can't charge your primary payment method.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>Automatic Renewal</strong> By enrolling in a subscription, you
					authorize us to automatically charge the then-applicable fees and
					Taxes for each subsequent subscription period until the subscription
					is canceled. If you received a discount, used a coupon code, or
					subscribed during a free trial or promotion, your subscription will
					automatically renew for the full price of the subscription at the end
					of the discount period. This means that unless you cancel a
					subscription, it'll automatically renew and we'll charge your payment
					method(s). You must cancel at least one month before the scheduled end
					date of any annual subscription and at least 24 hours before the end
					of any shorter subscription period. The date for the automatic renewal
					is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.
					If you've purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple
					renewal dates.
				</P>
				<P>
					You can view your renewal date(s), cancel, or manage subscriptions in
					your settings.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>Fees and Changes</strong> We may change our fees at any time
					in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law.
					This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging
					fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update
					features or functionality that were previously included in the fees.
					If you don't agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid
					Service.
				</P>

				<H2>Feedback</H2>

				<P>
					We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our
					Services. When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you
					agree that we're free to use them without any restriction or
					compensation to you.
				</P>

				<H2>Specific Service Terms</H2>
				<P>
					Gnocchi helps you keep track of weekly groceries and a collection of
					recipes. You can use it for free, and certain features are included in
					a paid subscription Service. We don't own your content, and you retain
					all ownership rights you have to content you add to Gnocchi, including
					recipes you create.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>Public Recipes</strong>. By default, all recipes you create
					are private, and only accessible to you and anyone else who is a
					member of your paid subscription. If you choose to make a recipe
					public, it will be visible to anyone who visits Gnocchi. You can make
					a recipe public at any time, and you can make a public recipe private
					at any time.
				</P>
				<P>
					By making a recipe public, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free,
					transferrable, sub-licensable, and non-exclusive license to use,
					reproduce, modify, distribute, adapt, publicly display, and publish
					the Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving our
					products and Services and promoting your recipe. You also give other
					Gnocchi.club users permission to create a copy of your recipe in their
					own private collection and add their own alterations to it, so long as
					they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your
					recipe.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>Removing Content</strong> if you delete Content, we'll use
					reasonable efforts to remove it from our Services, but you acknowledge
					that cached or archived copies of your Content may not be made
					immediately unavailable.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>Web Traffic</strong> We may use a third-party service to
					measure Gnocchi.club's audience and usage. By visiting Gnocchi.club,
					you agree to this monitoring.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>Attribution</strong> We may display attribution text or links
					on your recipes in the footer or any menus, noting that your recipe's
					website is powered by Gnocchi.club.
				</P>
				<P>
					<strong>The Recipe Scanner</strong> A Gnocchi subscription includes
					access to a tool called the "scanner" which reads webpages and returns
					detected ingredients and instructions for recipes. This scanner is
					meant to be used for personal convenience to quickly input information
					about recipes that <i>you already have legal right to access</i> for
					private use. Like a high-tech version of jotting things down on a
					piece of paper, or copy+paste. You may not attempt to use this scanner
					to pull information from sources that you do not have legal right to
					or right to privately reproduce. If your subscription has other
					members, you may not use this scanner to scan recipes which you do not
					have legal right to reproduce and share with those other members. You
					also may not publicly share the results of a scan with anyone outside
					the members your subscription, who will also have access to all
					recipes in the plan's collection. Scanned recipes may not be made
					public, even when altered, or used for any commercial purpose.
				</P>

				<H2>Copyright Policy</H2>
				<P>
					As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we
					respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe any
					Content violates your copyright, please{' '}

				</P>

				<H2>Intellectual Property</H2>
				<P>
					The Agreement doesn't transfer any Gnocchi.club or third-party
					intellectual property to you, and all right, title, and interest in
					and to such property remains (as between Gnocchi.club and you) solely
					with Gnocchi.club. Gnocchi.club, and all other trademarks, service
					marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our websites or

					changes to our Services (e.g., adding new features or benefits to our
					Services or retiring certain features of certain Services) or for
					legal, regulatory, or security reasons. If we do this, we'll provide
					notice of the changes, such as by posting the amended Terms and
					updating the “Last Updated” date or, if the changes, in our sole
					discretion, are material, we may notify you through our Services or
					other communications. Any changes will apply on a going-forward basis,
					and, unless we say otherwise, the amended Terms will be effective
					immediately. By continuing to use our Services after we've notified
					you, you agree to be bound by the new Terms. You have the right to

					terms. We have the right (though not the obligation) to (i) reclaim
					your username or website's URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii)
					refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates
					any part of this Agreement or any Gnocchi.club policy, or is in any
					way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make adjustments,

					deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or
					entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund

					export controls or sanctions.
				</P>

					any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between
					Gnocchi.club and you concerning our Services. If any part of the
					Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable
					from the Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability
					of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or
					condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance,
					will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach
					thereof. Gnocchi.club may assign its rights under the Agreement
					without condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement
					with our prior written consent.
